Open any record in the Dataverse Web Api and supercharge the output. Press to impress your coworkers!

All of your records can be quickly viewed and edited! Even when fields are not available on any form. Quickly view and edit Power Automate Flow definitions.

How to use:
- Click the extension button when viewing a form to open the current record in the Dataverse Web Api and prettify the output!
- When viewing a 'solution-aware' flow in make.powerautomate.com, use the extension to open it in the Dataverse Web Api. Click the Edit Flow button in the top right to edit your flow definition! This is very convenient for renaming actions/variables or as a last measure for working around bugs, when the default flow UI just doesn't want to cooperate (Power Automate developers will relate to this).
- When already viewing a record or query in the Dataverse Web Api, just use the extension to prettify!

You no longer need to open your solutions to view the values for your Option Sets/Choices. Simply open the record and prettify the output.

Browse to related records for quick insights using the 'Preview' button on lookup columns.

Update columns of a record by using the 'Edit this record' feature. Update text columns, Option Sets, numbers, lookups, etc. Very convenient for modifying data that is not available on a form. You also have the option to impersonate other users and skip custom plugins when updating a record.

Quickly copy the contents of a column to your clipboard by hovering and clicking the copy button.

You can prettify single records, but also the results of your OData and FetchXml queries.
