# PrettifyMyWebApi
Press to impress your coworkers!

Browse to records in the Dynamics OData Web Api and prettify the output. All of your Dynamics data available at your fingertips!

How to use:
Press the extension button when viewing a Dynamics form to open the current record in the Dynamics OData Web Api. Press again to prettify the output.

You no longer need to open your solutions to view the values for your Option Sets. Simply open the record and prettify the output.

Browse to related records for quick insights using the 'Preview' feature on lookup fields.

Update fields of a record by using the 'Edit this record' feature. Update text fields, Option Sets, numbers, etc. Very handy for modifying data that is not available on a form.

You can prettify single records, but also the results of your OData and FetchXml queries.
